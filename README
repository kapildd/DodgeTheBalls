Dodge the Balls is simple game which was my group's first game. It is a fun game where you use mouse to control one of the balls and you keep trying to dodge the others. Your goal is to try it for longest time.

Dodge The Balls uses FreeGLUT (even GLUT will work!) and GLFW libraries.
FreeGLUT >= 2.6.0-1
GLFW >= 2.7.2-1
